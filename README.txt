				Instructions for running the Plagiarism detector:


1.	Go to the folder where the Frame and java file is located.

2.	Open Command prompt or Powershell, in that directory.

3.	Type "javac <Filename>.java" . This function compiles the program.

4.	Once the code is compiled, type "java <filename>". This command runs the java code.

5.	When the program start running, a window pops up. This window is user interface, where the user can interact with the program regarding the plagiarism detection.

6.	The interface has 5 button on the left panel. The first button is used to import the plagiarised file, so that the program can check it for plagiarism.

7.	The next 4 buttons correspond to the unique algorithms (Naive String Search, LCSS, KMP, Boyer Moore). The user can run his preferred 	technique to get the output.

8.	The time taken by each algorithm is displayed on the Prompt or Shell in nanoseconds.
