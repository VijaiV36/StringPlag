Most states have, or are developing, tests to assess their students proficiency in state frameworks of curriculum. Many of these states are including students with limited English proficiency in this assessment process, but a significant number of LEP students have difficulty passing these standardized tests. In this website, Longman is pleased to provide additional practice for LEP students by offering sample standardized reading tests for grades 1 to 8. The reading tests provided here are a combination of multiple choice, short-answer, and long-answer questions. The short-answer and long-answer questions are designed to have students process the information in the passage, analyze it, and organize it for the answer. In this way, these practice questions test students’ analytical abilities, not just comprehension.

The answer shows that the student understood or responded to only part of what the question asked. The information in the answer may be correct and based on the passage, but may not be clearly written, or exact enough.
